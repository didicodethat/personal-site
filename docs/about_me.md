## About my Career

Always curious from young, discovered the world of coding
as a 15 year old by reading a entire PHP 5 book on OOP
programming, used those skills to make a few personal
projects at the time. In 2011 got into a summer course
about Ruby on Rails and HTML5, learned how to develop
things using the canvas API and got experience with Javascript,
not long after that landed a job at "M3 m√≠dias digitais" as
a front end developer, my main function was building and maintaining
websites using CakePHP and PHP in general,
but I ended leaving soon after to go to college at 
IFRN to get a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science Teaching. 

At the time I've landed a internship at "Technotech Sistemas" 
where I helped to develop and maintain Governamental Software 
for inspection on buildings, engineers and achitectures. At this 
job I've understood the importance of ethical software development
and communication skills with clients and developers alike.
The Stack was a internal PHP framework with PostgreSQL,
one of my main jobs was the implementation of new business logic
and creating reports and graphics for analysis.

After finishing my internship, I got hired at "Tribuna do Norte"
the main newspapwer for the state where I live (Rio Grande do Norte).
Helped to develop the [Tribuna Autos](https://tribunaautos.com.br) website using
Ruby on Rails, Coffeescript, Sass, Solr and PostgreSQL, 
there I was able to improve the workflow and coding 
quality by the implementation of tests, code reviews and pair programming. 
Sadly some of the projects I've worked
on there could never see the light of day due to downsizing 
and the company focus on printed media.

Some time after I've got hired at "Rits Technologia"
a outsorcing company for website and web application development.
There I've got the chance to work with multiple projects, with multiple
tools like Laravel, React, PostgreSQL, NodeJS. There I worked on a
project that now has since been discontinued, [https://signup.com.br](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230133732/https://signup.com.br/)
as a front end developer, creating new instances of the project and writing
templates according to designes that were given to me, like [https://remaxflix.com.br/](https://remaxflix.com.br/), 
the signup project was acquired by [netshow.me](https://netshow.me), and with
this acquisition I got hired to help the transition between companies.

In 2019 I was hired at Jurema.la, I helped to develop new features 
to [Sopha](https://sopha.com.br) Back-End and API a application that is used to help
people manage and follow the building of planned furniture for their homes..
This was built using React and Ruby on Rails. 

After 2 years I was called to work at ESPN and HSB, on a shared contract
between those 2 companies where I spent half of my time
on each of those companies, this contract lasted for 1 year.

At [HSB consultancy](https://hsbconsultoria.com.br/) my main job was to add new features to a Accounting Application
called [TAX FOLLOW-UP](https://taxfollowup.com/pt/) a organization tool 
inspired on trello, this tool was developed using CakePHP and React. One
of my biggest accomplishments on this app was creating a flowcharting
internal tool to organize how the flow of documents should occur internally.
The other application I designed and developed there was a Landing Page for a 
local branch of a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu School [Gracie Barra Natal](https://gbnatal.com.br/)
using Laravel (Orchid) and Sass. I've created this tool because I couldn't
stand working with Wordpress, so I rolled this app in 2 weeks.

And at ESPN I worked on a internal HR tool using Ruby on Rails I helped
to Dockerize the application and to make it run on windows machines,
made a avatar cropping tool to help users to crop their uploaded pictures,
Created a internal stand alone tool for location management using React,
the tool was created due the necessity of migrating it from a old Delphi
desktop application so it could also be used on mobile.
